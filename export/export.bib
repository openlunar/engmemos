 abstract = {We examine why international actors-including states, firms, and activists-seek different types of legalized arrangements to solve political and substantive problems. We show how particular forms of legalization provide superior institutional solutions in different circumstances. We begin by examining the baseline advantages of "hard" legalization (that is, precise, legally binding obligations with appropriate third-party delegation). We emphasize, however, that actors often prefer softer forms of legalization (that is, various combinations of reduced precision, less stringent obligation, and weaker delegation). Soft legalization has a number of significant advantages, including that it is easier to achieve, provides strategies for dealing with uncertainty, infringes less on sovereignty, and facilitates compromise among differentiated actors. Although our approach is largely interest-based, we explicitly incorporate the normative elements that are central in law and in recent international relations theorizing. We also consider the important role of nonstate actors who, along with states, are central participants in contemporary international legalization. We illustrate the advantages of various forms of international legal arrangements with examples drawn from articles in this special issue and elsewhere.},

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's immediate response was low-key, but he became worried about the spread of nuclear capabilities to the next country. Abandoning his previously dismissive stance toward the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Kissinger concluded that Washington had to work with allies and even cold-war adversaries to check proliferation. He approved a number of initiatives, one of which was to co-ordinate the nuclear-export policies of major states, the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. To make that possible, during 1974-5, Kissinger supported a complex diplomatic effort to create what became a major institution in the non-proliferation regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), and a set of guidelines for regulating the export of nuclear equipment, materials, and technology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {This report focuses on the health and competitiveness of the U.S. Space Industrial Base, including the associated impacts of U.S. export controls. The Department of Commerce (DOC), Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) developed, deployed, and verified data collection from a survey of space industry companies. The study involved a broad look at industrial base indicators and a detailed analysis of the BIS survey inputs. Foreign competition is real and growing. Moreover, there is some evidence that U.S. export controls give foreign competitors a perceived advantage in marketing to non-U.S. customers. Segments of the U.S. space industry feel threatened competitively and see export controls as the main factor undermining their ability to compete for sales in foreign markets. The U.S. space industry has, in general, been healthy for the 2003-2006 period and very competitive domestically for both defense and commercial products and services; however, the global space market has changed significantly since 1998-1999 when the U.S. Government made major modifications to its overall export control regulations for space-related products and services. The U.S. industry now faces strong and growing competition, primarily from European firms, and is losing market share in allied countries. Reportedly, ITAR has impacted U.S. competitiveness by encouraging other nations, in many cases our allies, to develop indigenous space capabilities and industries that now market globally.},

Against this backdrop, this article seeks to develop a systematic overview of open-source communities and their socio-economic contexts.

This is followed by the identification of four ideal-type variants of current open-source projects that differ significantly in their modes of coordination and the degree of corporate involvement. Further, I examine why open-source projects lost their subversive connotations while, in contrast to former cases of collective invention, remaining viable beyond the initial phase of innovation.},

abstract = {https://flemishpeaceinstitute.eu/sites/vlaamsvredesinstituut.eu/files/files/reports/revising_export_control_lists_web.pdf ---------- An export control system is one of a range of mechanisms that states can employ to govern the security concerns tied to goods and technologyI. It is a tool that has been used by states as long as states have existed, in conjunction with sanctions, embargos, interdictions, and intelligence activities. Put simply, export controls control the transfer out of a state of objects and knowledge of potential security concern. Any export control system must contain a list of items to control, a way of controlling the export, and a method of enforcing compliance with the system. Of these various parts of the export control system, perhaps the most under- studied are the lists of items under control. How did these items get onto (or off of) the lists? How is an item on a list related to an object that is actually exported? Who has a say in what is listed or not? This report addresses these questions by providing an analysis of the processes states go through to modify the lists they employ in their export control systems. The lists are often intricate, and while some are updated yearly, others go many years between modifications. While some items on the lists may be added by a single state or region, the majority of them derive from multilaterally agreed lists that have been in place for decades. Understanding how these lists change is a key part of both being involved in the process and being able to critique the process. This document aides that understanding.},

abstract = {The 113th Congress may consider reforms of the U.S. export control system. The balance between national security and export competitiveness has made the subject of export controls controversial for decades. Through the Export Administration Act (EAA), the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and other authorities, the United States restricts the export of defense items or munitions; so-called "dual-use" goods and technology-items with both civilian and military applications; certain nuclear materials and technology; and items that would assist in the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons or the missile technology used to deliver them. U.S. export controls are also used to restrict exports to certain countries on which the United States imposes economic sanctions. At present, the EAA has expired and dual-use controls are maintained under IEEPA authorities. The U.S. export control system is diffused among several different licensing and enforcement agencies. Exports of dual-use goods and technologies are licensed by the Department of Commerce, munitions are licensed by the Department of State, and restrictions on exports based on U.S. sanctions are administered by the U.S. Treasury. Enforcement of export controls is conducted by these agencies as well as by units of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Aspects of the U.S. export control system have long been criticized by exporters, nonproliferation advocates, and other stakeholders as being too rigorous, insufficiently rigorous, cumbersome, obsolete, inefficient, or any combination of these descriptions. In August 2009, the Obama Administration launched a comprehensive review of the U.S. export control system. In April 2010, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates proposed an outline of a new system based on four singularities: a single export control licensing agency for both dual-use and munitions exports, a unified control list, a single enforcement coordination agency, and a single integrated information technology (IT) system. The rationalization of the two control lists has been the Administration's focus to date. Interim steps have also been taken to create a single IT system and to establish an export enforcement coordination center. No specific proposals have been made concerning the single licensing agency. In contrast to the Administration's approach, legislation was introduced to reauthorize or rewrite the EAA in the 112th Congress. The Export Administration Renewal Act of 2011 (H.R. 2122, RosLehtinen) would have renewed the currently expired Export Administration Act through 2015, updated its penalty and enforcement provisions, and provided stricter foreign policy controls on countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. A separate title would have amended the Arms Export Control Act to permit generic parts and components for defense articles to be controlled differently than sensitive defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List. By contrast, the Technology Security Act of 2011 (H.R. 2004, Berman) would have rewritten the dual-use export control statute by giving the President the authority to control exports for national security and foreign policy reasons and to create the mechanisms for doing so. Each bill would, if passed, have implications for the President's reform efforts. In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 (P.L. 112-239), signed by the President on January 2, 2013, contains a provision to repeal 1998 legislation that placed commercial communications satellites (CCS) under munitions export licensing jurisdiction and to permit the President to determine the export control jurisdiction of CCS. In considering the future of the U.S. export control system, Congress may weigh the merits of a unified export control system-the end result of the President's proposal-or the continuation of the present bifurcated system by reauthorizing the present EAA or writing new legislation. In doing so, Congress may debate the record of the present dual-use system maintained by emergency authority, the aims and effectiveness of the present non-proliferation control regimes, the maintenance of the defense industrial base, and the delicate balance between the maintenance of economic competitiveness and the preservation of national security.},
